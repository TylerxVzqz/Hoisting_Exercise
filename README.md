# Hoisting Exercise

Hello, future software developer! In this exercise, you will practice hoisting. 🎈

As a developer 🧑‍💻 at the Time Travel Agency 🌀, your task is to organize travel plans for adventurous time travelers. You'll use `var`, `let`, `const`, and demonstrate `variable hoisting` to manage travel details.

Your tasks are:

1. **Declare a Destination Variable**: Use `let` to declare a variable named `destination` and assign it the value `"Ancient Egypt"`. Print the destination to the console.
2. **Change the Destination**: Now, change the `destination` variable to `"Medieval Europe"`. Print the new destination to the console.
3. **Declare a Constant Travel Date**: Use `const` to declare a variable named `travelDate` and set it to `"2024-03-15"`. Try to change the `travelDate` to another value and observe and explain what happens as a comment.
4. **Experiment with Variable Hoisting**: Before declaring any variable, try to print a variable named `timeMachineModel` to the console. Then, declare `timeMachineModel` using `var` and assign it the value `"T-800"`. Observe and explain what happens as a comment.

In the starter code, we left TODOs for you. Those are the places where you will implement the above tasks.
